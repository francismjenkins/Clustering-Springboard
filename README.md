This project involved cluster and PCA analysis on a dataset containing wine sales data. K-means clustering and PCA was performed
as well as cluster analyisis using the following algorithms:

Affinity propagation
Spectral clustering
Agglomerative clustering
DBSCAN

And the results were compared (DBSCAN outperformed the other models, followed by agglomerative clustering).
