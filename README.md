# Clustering-Springboard
Clustering and PCA with Python

This project involved cluster and PCA analysis on a dataset containing wine sales data. K-means clustering and PCA was performed
as well as cluster analyisis using the following algorithms:

1. Affinity propagation

2. Spectral clustering

3. Agglomerative clustering

4. DBSCAN

And the results were compared (DBSCAN outperformed the other models, followed by agglomerative clustering).
